# JavaScript Katas Challenge

Welcome to the JavaScript Katas Challenge! This project is designed to help you practice and improve your JavaScript skills by solving a series of coding challenges (katas).

## How to Use

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get this repository onto your local machine.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will install the `assert` module, which is used for testing.
3.  **Solve the Katas:**
    *   Open the `katas/beginner.js`, `katas/intermediate.js`, and `katas/hard.js` files.
    *   Inside each file, you'll find function definitions with `// Your code here` comments.
    *   Implement the logic for each function according to its description and the provided test cases.
    *   **Do not modify the function names or the `testCases` arrays.** Only write your code within the function bodies.
4.  **Run the Tests:**
    *   After implementing a function (or a few), save the file.
    *   Open your terminal in the project root directory (`katas/`).
    *   Run the challenge:
        ```bash
        node index.js
        ```
5.  **Check Your Progress:**
    *   The output in your terminal will show a `✅` (green tick) next to the function name if all its tests pass, and a `❌` (red cross) if any test fails.
    *   If a test fails, an error message will indicate which test case failed. Use this feedback to debug your code.

## Kata Categories

The katas are divided into three categories based on difficulty:

*   **Beginner Katas:** Focus on fundamental JavaScript concepts, syntax, and basic problem-solving.
*   **Intermediate Katas:** Require more complex logic, array manipulation, and potentially object-oriented thinking.
*   **Hard Katas:** Challenge your understanding of algorithms and data structures.

Good luck, and happy coding!
